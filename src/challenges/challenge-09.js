/*
 * Converts a string to a list of hashtags. A
 * hashtag begins with '#' and has no spaces.
 * Also uppercases the hashtagged words.
 *
 * If the string has more than three words, pick
 * the three longest and make the hashtag from
 * those.
 *
 * E.g:
 * Input: 'Amazing bongo drums for sale'
 * Output: ['#Amazing', '#Bongo', '#Drums']
